The Art of Illuminating font
Made by Staffan Vilcans.

Based on an image scanned from The Art of Illuminating As Practised in Europe from the Earliest Times by W. R. Symms, with an Essay and Instructions by M. D. Wyatt, Architect. London. Published April 2nd 1860 by Day and Son, Lithographers to the Queen.

The image came from http://fromoldbooks.org/ and if you feel the urge you may donate money to him. This font is free (as in beer). You may install the font on as many computers you wish, but I ask you to kindly give med credit if you include it in a collelction or put it up for download. I know that the font lacks some characters. If you want to add them, please do, but send me the updated font so I can include it in the next release. You will ofcourse be credited as a co-creator.
